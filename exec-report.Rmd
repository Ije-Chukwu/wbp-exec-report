## Project Topic: DHS Data Management and Analysis of Gender Inequality in Reproductive Women across LMICs using IPUMS-DHS Dataset

### Project Background

The Biostatistics and Health Data Science Group, is a multi-disciplinary academic research and teaching under the IAHS characteristic by collaborative research, consultancy and training across clinical, biological and global health domains. In the global health domain where I was assigned to, the data used to conduct the research as well as for training purposes are collected from a number of secure sources, including the [The DHS-Program](https://dhsprogram.com).

The DHS-Program, funded by USAID collects nationally representative global health data, to monitor and evaluate population, health, and nutrition programs, providing data to track approximately 30 SDG indicators. They provides these data for tracking as well as measure to track them, contributing significantly towards achieving the SDG 3 and 5 (The DHS Program, 2025).

However, the DHS-Program has been suspended and currently undergoing review for further funding. During the period of this review, new registrations are not being accepted, hence restricting access to datasets commonly used by undergraduate and post graduate students for their theses and training, especially in LMICs, thereby significantly hampering preparations for future national and global health leadership training in addition to other far-reaching effects.

My project focused on collecting, organizing, merging and analyzing, datasets from DHS-program relevant to our global health projects. While this mitigates the recent suspension of the DHS-program for students and researchers within the team working on global health projects, it also gave me an opportunity to familiarize with global health data and perform exploratory data analysis on aspects of Gender Inequality including Female Genital Mutilation, Intimate Partner Violence and Autonomy of Health Care Decision Making which are often intertwined and are prevalent issues for women of child bearing age in LMICs(Wessells & Kostelny, 2022).

### Project Aim

This project achieved two aims

1.  Created a global health data repository of DHS Datasets for 38 years (1984-2022)
2.  Pooled Cross country Exploratory Data Analysis of Gender Inequalities in women of child bearing age.

### Methods

The project was carried out in three phases and documentation was ensured for transparency and reproducibility of the workflow and analysis results.

The data was from DHS-Program website using my supervisor's login. To access datasets, new users must [register for an account](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm) on the [The DHS-Program](https://dhsprogram.com) website.

#### Phase 1: Auto-download of DHS Datasets

A structured reproducible workflow was scripted using R Markdown which serves as a comprehensive toolkit for accessing, processing, and locally managing DHS downloads, enabling seamless data retrieval for collaborative research in support of global health studies. It ensure secure data access, automates downloads, and systematically unzips, organizes and saves the datasets in hierarchical file structure.`FileName/CountryName/SurveyYear/DataType`. The workflow is specifically for DHS Datasets in SPSS and STATA formats as specified in my project tasks.

#### Phase 2: DHS IR File Merge (Pilot merge)

A structured, reproducible workflow was developed to merge DHS Individual Recode (IR) datasets for 2 countries (Kenya and Tanzania 2022) using SPSS Syntax. A cross-country unique identifiers `UCASEID` was created by concatenating country-cluster and case IDs. Subsets containing the `UCASEID` and relevant IPV variables were saved and merged using SPSS commands. This workflow can be adapted for additional countries and survey rounds, and replicated for different variables, provided that the variable names, labels, and meanings are first confirmed to be consistent according to the DHS Recode Manual (The DHS Program, 2025). See syntax of workflow in [Appendix 1](Appendix%201).

#### Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis and Results using IPUMS-DHS Data

Exploratory data analysis was done using datasets from [IPUMS-DHS website](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) which are harmonized DHS survey datasets across countries and over time. Initial Cross-tabulations was done for key variables using SPSS, SPSS output tables were cleaned excel with steps documented (see [Appendix 2](Appendix 2) ) and results imported into R to create visual interactive plots.

This plot presents the distribution of women's reported experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV) across countries. The response categories include: "Not ever slapped," "Often during last 12 months," "Sometimes during last 12 months," "Not at all in last 12 months," and "Yes, timing and frequency unknown." Most countries show that a significant proportion of women have never been slapped by an intimate partner, but in many settings, notable percentages report being slapped at least sometimes or often within the past year. Variability across countries is visible, with some (e.g., Sao Tome and Principe, Zimbabwe) having higher frequencies of violence, and others (e.g., India, Senegal) showing larger shares of respondents reporting no experience of IPV.

This plot presents the percentage response of women who have experienced female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) within country, with responses categorized as "yes," "no," and "don't know." There is wide country variation: nations like Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali, Gambia, and Egypt show extremely high percentages of women reporting being circumcised (often over 80%), while countries such as Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania, and others report relatively low response rate. The "don't know" response is almost negligible in most contexts. The significant country-to-country differences reflects varying cultural, legal, and historical norms about FGM/C practices.

##### III. AHCDM: percentage of women who have the final say on their health care within country, variable code= DECFEMHCARE

```{r ahcdm-percentage-plot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Define response categories

  "Woman alone",
  "Woman and husband/partner",
  "Woman and someone else",
  "Husband/partner",
  "Family elders/relatives"
)

# Reshape to long format for plotting
ahcdm_long <- dfahcdm %>%
  select(country, all_of(response_ahcdm)) %>%

fig3_ahcdm <- plot_ly(

```

The chart shows women’s reported autonomy and roles in health care decision-making by `country` and response categories `response_ahcdm`. In many countries, the largest proportion of women say decisions are made “with their husband/partner” or by their “husband/partner” alone, reflecting persistent gender norms around health autonomy. However, countries such as Mozambique, Lesotho, and Madagascar display higher shares for “Woman alone,” indicating stronger female decision-making autonomy. “Woman and someone else” and “Family elders/relatives” are minor categories in most contexts, suggesting these are less common arrangements for household health decisions.

### Implications for the Organisation:

-   The Auto-download workflow can be used by the team to access and download datasets from DHS-Program website for future research projects
-   The IPUMS-DHS file merge workflow can be used by the team to merge IR datasets from IPUMS-DHS website for future research projects.
-   The EDA scripts can be used by the team to carry out exploratory data analysis on IPUMS-DHS datasets for future research projects.
-   The documentation and reproducible workflows can be used by the team to understand the process of accessing, downloading, merging and analysing datasets from DHS-Program and IPUMS-DHS website for future research projects.
-   The variable mappings can be used by the team to understand the variables in DHS and IPUMS-DHS datasets.
