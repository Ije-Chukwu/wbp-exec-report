## Part A. Main report:

Evidencing academic skills in the workplace including collection of relevant data, synthesis, analysis and interpretation; and clearly communicating data science outputs to relevant stakeholders.

### Project Background

The Biostatistics and Health Data Science Group, is a multi-disciplinary academic research and teaching under the IAHS charcteristed by collaborative research, consultancy and training across clinical, biological and global health domains. In the global health domain where I was assigned to, the data used to conduct the research as well as for training purposes are collected from a number of secure sources, including the [The DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com).

The DHS Program, funded by USAID collects nationally representative global health data, primarily to monitor and evaluate population, health, and nutrition programs, providing data to track approximately 30 SDG indicators[1](https://dhsprogram.com/topics/sdgs/index.cfm) which aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)[@dhs2025]

However, the DHS Program has been suspended and currently undergoing review for further funding. During the period of this review, new registerations are not being accepted, hence restricting access to datasets in addition to other far-reaching effect as highlighted by (cite when data goes dark). This professional work-based placement project, with the Biostatistics and Health Data Science group, UoA, aims to gather, synthesize and analyse, datasets from Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS) program that are relevant to global health projects relevant to the team. This is to mitigate the recent suspension of the dhs program, hence limiting access to only existing registered users as new registerations/data requests are not being accepted.

Access was given to me using my supervisor's login to carry out my data acquisition from DHS Program website, however, Exploratory data analysis was done using harmonized datasets from [IPUMS-DHS website](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) as merging of DHS datasets was not feasible due to memory and time constraint. IPUMS-DHS harmonizes data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across countries and over time. The integrated microdata extracted from IPUMS-DHS enables cross-country and trend analyses over time. The data is free to use for research and teaching purposes, however, users must register for an account and agree to the terms of use.

To access datasets, new users must [register for an account](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm) on the [The DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com) website and [apply for datasets](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/apply) on the [IPUMS-DHS](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) website.

### Project Aim

This project achieved two aims

1.  Created a global health data repository of DHS Datasets for 38 years (1984-2022)
2.  Pooled Cross country Exploratory Data Analysis of Gender Inequalities in women of child bearing age.

### Methods

The project was carried out in two phases: Documentation was ensured all through the project wth provides clear instructions and explanation of codes to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the workflow results and analysis results.

#### Autodownload_Workflow

A structured workflow which serves as a comprehensive toolkit for accessing, processing, and locally managing DHS downloads was scripted using R Markdown, enabling seamless data retrieval for collaborative research. This repository is designes to support global health studies by providing structured reproducible scripts that ensure secure data access, automate downloads, and systematically oraganize datasets for pooled cross-country analysis.

The workflow includes the following key components: - Secure data access: Utilizes DHS login credentials to authenticate and access datasets. - Automated downloads: Scripts to automatically download specified datasets based on user-defined parameters (e.g., country, year, survey type). - Data organization: Systematically organizes downloaded datasets into a structured directory for easy access and management. -

#### IPUMS-DHS File Merge Workflow

A structured workflow for merging IPUMS-DHS datasets from multiple countries and years was scripted using R Markdown, enabling seamless integration of harmonized data for comprehensive cross-country analysis. This repository is designed to support global health studies by providing structured reproducible scripts that ensure efficient data merging, variable mapping, and dataset management.

The workflow includes the following key components: - Data import: Scripts to import IPUMS-DHS datasets based on user-defined parameters (e.g., country, year). - Variable mapping: Aligns variables across different datasets to ensure consistency and comparability. - Data merging: Combines datasets from multiple countries and years into a single comprehensive dataset for analysis. - Documentation: Provides clear instructions and documentation to facilitate use by other researchers.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis of Gender Inequalities using IPUMS-DHS Data

-   Dataset overview
-   IPV
-   FGM
-   AHCDM

### Outcomes

-   Autodownload scripts for DHS Datasets
-   Variable mappings (DHS and IPUMS-DHS)
-   EDA Rmarkdown scripts
-   SPSS EDA Syntax files
-   SPSS EDA Outputs
-   SPSS Syntax file for pilot file merge (Kenya-Tanzania DHS IR Files 2021)
-   Documentation and reproducible workflows for IPUMS-DHS file merge

Output is saved to One drive folder in the below order

### Implications for the Organisation:

-   The Autodownload workflow can be used by the team to access and download datasets from DHS program website for future research projects
-   The IPUMS-DHS file merge workflow can be used by the team to merge IR datasets from IPUMS-DHS website for future research projects.
-   The EDA scripts can be used by the team to carry out exploratory data analysis on IPUMS-DHS datasets for future research projects.
-   The documentation and reproducible workflows can be used by the team to understand the process of accessing, downloading, merging and analysing datasets from DHS program and IPUMS-DHS website for future research projects.
-   The variable mappings can be used by the team to understand the variables in DHS and IPUMS-DHS datasets.
-   The SPSS syntax files can be used by the team to carry out exploratory data analysis on IPUMS-DHS datasets using SPSS as well as verify results without having to perform the analysis from scratch.

### Academic skills in the workplace to highlight.

-   collection of relevant data: DHS, IPUM-DHS data access and download - synthesis: data wrangling, variable mapping, dataset merging
-   analysis and interpretation; EDA, visualisation, reporting
-   Reproducibility: Use of Rmarkdown with adequate documentation, version control and renv. setting ensured, SPSS syntax documented for every step of the analysis carried out on spss. -data security and ethical considerations: Data accessed with secure login details, data stored on secure UoA servers, no data shared with third parties. -data quality checks: Missing data, outliers, duplicates, inconsistencies

### Communication Channels/Methods

-   Output templates: Rmarkdown file, SPSS syntax,excel/text file documentations
-   Communication Channel: Email, Power-point Presentation
-   Reporting: Executive report, EDA reports
-   Visualisation: Plotly, ggplot2
